# Boundless Fusion

Boundless Fusion is a cursed game engine that is designed to be a cross platform masterpiece. **Please note that this project is under development!**

## Building

Building should be just as simple as running `make` in the root directory of this project. You can also go into the platform directory of your choice and run `make` there to build just that platform.

## How to use

Please head over to the `docs` folder. There you will find a bunch of documentation on how to use this engine. If you have any additional questions, please open an issue or join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5n8ttQfSqF).

## Adding a new platform

Please head over to the `README.md` file inside the platforms directory for more information on how to add a new platform.
