# Boundless Fusion

Boundless Fusion is a cursed game engine that is designed to be a cross platform masterpiece. You probably don't want to use it.

## Building

Building should be just as simple as running `make` in the root directory of this project. You can also go into the platform directory of your choice and run `make` there to build just that platform.

## How to use

At the moment, there is no way to use this engine. You can edit the `lib_loop` function in `library/lib_main.cpp`, but that's about it.
